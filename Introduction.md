# Introduction

## Purpose of the Tool

The Heart Disease Risk Prediction Tool is designed to provide a straightforward way for anyone to assess their risk of heart disease. By identifying potential risk early, the tool encourages preventive measures and promotes healthier lifestyles.

## Overview

This tool was developed using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). It employs statistical modeling (logistic regression) to estimate heart disease risk based on key predictors selected from authoritative sources, including:

- Age
- Smoking status
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Pre-existing conditions

> For example:
- Individuals with diabetes have a two-to-four-fold increased risk (American Diabetes Association, 2020).
- Physical inactivity increases risk, while regular activity can reduce it by 20â€“30% (WHO, 2010; Lee et al., 2012).
