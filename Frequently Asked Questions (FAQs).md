## 2. What data do I need to use the model?

You will need the following input variables:

- Smoking status (1 = smoker, 0 = non-smoker)
- Age (in years)
- Body Mass Index (BMI Ã— 100)
- Diabetes diagnosis (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
- Alcohol consumption (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- COPD status (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Kidney disease diagnosis (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Depression diagnosis (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Arthritis diagnosis (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## 3. How accurate is the model?

The model has a **pseudo R-squared value of 0.4839**, which means it explains approximately **48.39% of the variation in heart disease risk** based on the input variables.

## 4. Can the model be updated in the future?

Yes. The model can be improved by:

- Incorporating additional predictors
- Validating with local data
- Using advanced modeling techniques (e.g., machine learning)

## 5. How does this model support public wellness?

It helps by:

- Identifying high-risk individuals
- Encouraging early health screenings
- Informing targeted prevention strategies

## 6. What should I do after getting a high-risk score?

If the predicted probability is high, consider:

- Scheduling a medical consultation
- Engaging in healthier lifestyle choices
- Monitoring your risk factors over time
